# Terminator Configuration

\# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.

\# export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

​

\# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.

 export ZSH="/root/.oh-my-zsh"

​

\# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will

\# load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,

\# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM\_THEME

\# See https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes

ZSH\_THEME="agnoster"

​

\# Set list of themes to pick from when loading at random

\# Setting this variable when ZSH\_THEME=random will cause zsh to load

\# a theme from this variable instead of looking in ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/

\# If set to an empty array, this variable will have no effect.

\# ZSH\_THEME\_RANDOM\_CANDIDATES=\( "robbyrussell" "agnoster" \)

​

\# Uncomment the following line to use case-sensitive completion.

\# CASE\_SENSITIVE="true"

​

\# Uncomment the following line to use hyphen-insensitive completion.

\# Case-sensitive completion must be off. \_ and - will be interchangeable.

\# HYPHEN\_INSENSITIVE="true"

​

\# Uncomment the following line to disable bi-weekly auto-update checks.

\# DISABLE\_AUTO\_UPDATE="true"

​

\# Uncomment the following line to change how often to auto-update \(in days\).

\# export UPDATE\_ZSH\_DAYS=13

​

\# Uncomment the following line to disable colors in ls.

\# DISABLE\_LS\_COLORS="true"

​

\# Uncomment the following line to disable auto-setting terminal title.

\# DISABLE\_AUTO\_TITLE="true"

​

\# Uncomment the following line to enable command auto-correction.

ENABLE\_CORRECTION="true"

​

\# Uncomment the following line to display red dots whilst waiting for completion.

COMPLETION\_WAITING\_DOTS="true"

​

\# Uncomment the following line if you want to disable marking untracked files

\# under VCS as dirty. This makes repository status check for large repositories

\# much, much faster.

\# DISABLE\_UNTRACKED\_FILES\_DIRTY="true"

​

\# Uncomment the following line if you want to change the command execution time

\# stamp shown in the history command output.

\# You can set one of the optional three formats:

\# "mm/dd/yyyy"\|"dd.mm.yyyy"\|"yyyy-mm-dd"

\# or set a custom format using the strftime function format specifications,

\# see 'man strftime' for details.

\# HIST\_STAMPS="mm/dd/yyyy"

​

\# Would you like to use another custom folder than $ZSH/custom?

\#ZSH\_CUSTOM=~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins

​

\# Which plugins would you like to load?

\# Standard plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/\*

\# Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/

\# Example format: plugins=\(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse\)

\# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.

plugins=\(

 git

 colored-man-pages

 zsh-syntax-highlighting

 zsh-autosuggestions

\)

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

​

\# User configuration

​

\# export MANPATH="/usr/local/man:$MANPATH"

​

\# You may need to manually set your language environment

\# export LANG=en\_US.UTF-8

​

\# Preferred editor for local and remote sessions

\# if \[\[ -n $SSH\_CONNECTION \]\]; then

\# export EDITOR='nano'

\# else

\# export EDITOR='nano'

\# fi

​

\# Compilation flags

\# export ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86\_64"

​

\# ssh

\# export SSH\_KEY\_PATH="~/.ssh/rsa\_id"

​

\# Set personal aliases, overriding those provided by oh-my-zsh libs,

\# plugins, and themes. Aliases can be placed here, though oh-my-zsh

\# users are encouraged to define aliases within the ZSH\_CUSTOM folder.

\# For a full list of active aliases, run \`alias\`.

\#

\# Example aliases

 alias zshconfig="mate ~/.zshrc"

\# alias ohmyzsh="mate ~/.oh-my-zsh"

alias ss="searchsploit"

alias l='ls -la'

alias webup='python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80'

alias rtfm="/opt/rtfm/rtfm.py"

alias xclip="xclip -sel c"

alias ltr="ls -ltr"

alias cdb="echo /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt \| xclip"

alias clearwhite="sed 's/^\[ \t\]\*//' -i"
