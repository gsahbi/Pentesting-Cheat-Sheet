## Log all commands of the current session <a id="log-all-commands-of-the-current-session"></a>

```text
script $target.log....commands and output of commands you ran in that 1 terminal sesssion....exit # when finished
```

### Use Cherrytree or OneNote other to document findings...even a text file! <a id="use-cherrytree-or-onenote-other-to-document-findings-even-a-text-file"></a>

### Create a screenshot of the selected area and save it at home directory <a id="create-a-screenshot-of-the-selected-area-and-save-it-at-home-directory"></a>

## Set the Target IP Address to the $ip system variable <a id="set-the-target-ip-address-to-the-usdip-system-variable"></a>

If you're working on a single target it is useful to do the `export ip=target_ip` command before you run Tmux. That way when you create new tabs in Tmux you don't have to run the export command for every new tab.
