# Intro

Check out [Pentest.ws](https://pentest.ws/features) a tool I rely on so much to help speed up my workflow when attacking HTB or OSCP machines.

Thanks to guif, g0tmi1k, fuzzysecurity, practical hacking, xapax and all other sites I've used to allow me to collate this document.

No doubt there will be mistakes in this guide. Please let me know so I can improve it. Also if can you provide useful context on some commands like hints and tips - let me know so I can add them. Comment on [http://offsecnewbie.com/2018/12/05/pentesting-guide/](http://offsecnewbie.com/2018/12/05/pentesting-guide/) to get in contact. Thank you, rowbot

If you appreciate the collation of notes as well as my notes you can [**buy me a coffee**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/OffSecNewbie) ‚òïÔ∏è üòâ. This not only help with caffeine but also contribute towards lab time for OSCP. Thank you
